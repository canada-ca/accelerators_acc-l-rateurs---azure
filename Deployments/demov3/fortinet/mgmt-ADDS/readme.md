This will deploy two Microsoft Active Directory servers as shown in demo-mgmt-ADDS-v1.1.vsdx Visio diagram.

To deploy the infrastructure you 1st need to have deployed a fully functional core infrastructure using one of the demo-core-xxxx deployments. You then simply execute the masterdeploy.ps1 script found in this folder to deploy the two ADDS servers:

```
    .\masterdeploy.ps1
```

At the end you will receive information about the private IP address of the ADDS servers you can connect to via RDP from the jumpbox01 server located in the core infrastructure. It will look something like:

```
    You can RDP to the Active Directory servers at 10.25.8.20 an 10.25.8.21
```

You will also need to update the dhcp options in the management vnet to allow servers in that vnet to use the ADDS servers as the DNS. This is required to be able to join the domain in the vnet. This can ve accomplished by editing subnet-vnet parameters file of the mamagement vnet to add the following dhcp option to and redeploy it to Azure:

```
    "dhcpOptions":  {
        "dnsServers": [
            "10.25.8.20",
            "10.25.8.21"
        ]
    },
```

There is already a modified parameters file in the infra-fortinet-nsg parameters folder called deploy-20-vnet-subnet-mgmt-postadds.parameters.json... so no need to edit any file to complete the next step.

You then need to re-deploy the management vnet using the modified parameter file with:

```
    cd <folder where the infra-fortinet-nsg is located>
    .\scripts\deploysub.ps1 -parameterFile .\parameters\deploy-20-vnet-subnet-mgmt-postadds.parameters.json
```
